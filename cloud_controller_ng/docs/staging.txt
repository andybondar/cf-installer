By default staging will be synchronous, i.e. CC / CCNG submits a staging job
to the stager / dea_ng, and it waits until it finishes. You can request
asynchronous staging via stage_async param but CC might fallback to synchronous
staging.

Possible VMCs:
- VMC does not specify stage_async=1 staging will happen synchronously
- VMC specifies stage_async=1 query param for PUT /apps/:id

  Possible CCs:
  - CC will ignore it and continue with sync staging
  - CCNG will include async flag in staging request

    Possible stagers:
    - Stager will ignore and continue with sync staging
    - Dea_ng will async stage the app
